This will host the code for the projects I present in the different posts on my website [lucblassel.com](https://lucblassel.com/)  
It is meant to be used with the website and to show how the methods I describe are implemented and how I generate y figures. 

 - [CART](https://lucblassel.com/2019/03/02/lets-implement-CART.html)
 - [Linear regression](https://lucblassel.com/2020/01/09/implementing-linear-regression.html)
